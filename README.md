# Python_Projects
This is a repository for some of the projects I have done in python.

## device_monitor
This project is intended to act primarily as a serial console for Positioning Universal devices.
* Parses important data from the device output and displays it in a user friendly way.
* Text highlighting to serial output.
* A GUI for sideloading firmware using the puibtool.exe.
* A log parser to help find important information in device logs.
* Built in automation for changing device settings.
* Comes with tools to build the application into an executable that can run on any Windows system.

## saint_emulation_builder
This project will generate J1979 emulation files for the DGTech SAINT2 Systems Analysis Interface Tool
* Generates an emulation file based on user inputted values for common J1979 parameters such as RPM, Vehicle Speed, Odometer, etc.
* An easy to use GUI that helps the user quickly generate the files they need.
* Comes with tools to build the application into an executable that can run on any Windows system.

*Note: both of these projects were completed during my employement at Positioning Universal Inc. I do not claim any copyright or patent on these projects
and present them here only as an example of my work.*
